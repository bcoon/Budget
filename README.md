Budget
======

Basic budgeting tool created for the purpose of learning some things about Android programming.

Topics covered include: 
JSON parsing
using internal storage and user preferences
general interaction with Android objects (intents, activities, dialog boxes, textviews, etc.)

Note: this project is not complete.  
I have put it aside since the additions I have planned are repetative and not teaching new things
(and I am comfortable with the parts I would be repeating).

TODOs listed in the project classes.  Also need to verify inputs are correct.
